## Development Priorities

1. **Correctness:** Ensure the plugin works correctly in all scenarios
2. **Performance:** Minimize impact on IDE performance
3. **User Experience:** Create intuitive, non-intrusive features
4. **Extensibility:** Design for future expansion
5. **Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility with different Rider versions

## Testing Strategy

### Continuous Testing

- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for component interaction
- UI tests for visual elements
- Performance tests for critical operations

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Run tests that pass
   - Run tests that fail
   - Verify title bar changes
   - Navigate through failed tests

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Very large test suites
   - Tests with long names
   - Multiple project windows
   - Plugin disable/enable

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Different testing frameworks
   - Different project types
   - Different Rider versions
   - Different operating systems

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks

1. **API Changes:** JetBrains Platform API may change
   - Mitigation: Use stable APIs where possible
   - Contingency: Monitor EAP releases for changes

2. **Performance Impact:** Document listening may affect performance
   - Mitigation: Optimize event handling
   - Contingency: Make feature optional

3. **UI Inconsistencies:** Different themes/OS may affect UI
   - Mitigation: Test on multiple platforms
   - Contingency: Provide fallback UI options

4. **Test Framework Compatibility:** Different test frameworks may behave differently
   - Mitigation: Test with multiple frameworks
   - Contingency: Add framework-specific adapters

## Success Criteria

The plugin will be considered successful when:

1. It correctly identifies and displays test failures
2. Navigation to failed tests works reliably
3. Automatic test execution works without disrupting workflow
4. Performance impact is minimal
5. User feedback is positive

This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing the TddHelper plugin, with clear phases, milestones, and deliverables.
